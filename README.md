# Basic Calculator in four versions 

This is a personal project constaining four versions of a basic calculator. It aims to present different approaches to perform the four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, depending upon the user input. Next, I describe each version. 


## BasicCalculator Version 1A.py

* Features:
- User chooses the desired operation. Only two numbers are taken from user for the four basic arithmetic operations.
- basic arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of two numbers that user inputs.
- history of previous calculations.

## BasicCalculator Version 1B.py 

This is the refactored version of BasicCalculator 1A.   

## BasicCalculator Version 2A.py 

This is an upgraded version with the possibility to perform basic arithmetic operations with multiple numbers. 

* Features: 
- basic arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of two numbers that user inputs.
- possibility to make operations with multiple numbers. 
- history of previous calculations with date and time 

  
## BasicCalculator_2B.py

This last version in a calculator in Python using Tkinter to build an interface. The code is divided in two parts: 


###   Part 1: Functions
    1 -  Update mathematical expressions when user presses a button
    2 -  Evaluate the final expression using Try/Except for error handling
    3 -  Clear up the content in the Text Box


###   Part 2: Driver code 
    1 - Creating GUI window and setting configuration
    2 - Instanciating class StringVar to construct a string variable
    3 - Creating an entry box to show the mathematical expressions
    4 - Expression_box.grid (columnspan=4, ipadx=70)
    5 - Placing widgets at respective positions in table like structure
    6 - Creating buttons and defining their positions in the window
    7 - Starting GUI with a main loop
